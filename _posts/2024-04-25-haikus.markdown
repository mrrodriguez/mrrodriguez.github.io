## AI

```
I have a problem
I cannot figure it out
I ask the AI
```

## Meta

```
With five syllables
I can say nothing useful
With seven I can
```

```
I wrote this myself
I knew it would be real good
I think I was wrong
```

## Programming

```
At work I write code
Sometimes it makes me angry
Then I type faster
```

```
I’m using TypeScript
It’s JavaScript but better
No more type errors
```
