# Background

This is a continuation of my post ["From Emacs to Neovim"]({% post_url 2024-05-20-emacs-to-neovim %}). In this post, I am going to share some concrete configuration examples and concepts that have helped me adapting to vim configuration and bindings coming from an emacs background.

Note that my current, primary tooling focus is:
* [spacemacs distribution](https://www.spacemacs.org) of emacs primarily for Clojure/ClojureScript development
* [neovim distribution](https://neovim.io) of vim for simple terminal file editing
* [vscode-neovim](https://github.com/vscode-neovim/vscode-neovim) for TypeScript/JavaScript development

# Neovim configuration

# Spacemacs configuration

# VSCode configuration
